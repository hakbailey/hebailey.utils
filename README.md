# Hebailey Utils Collection

This repository contains the `hebailey.utils` Ansible Collection.

<!--start requires_ansible-->
## Ansible version compatibility

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions: **>=2.15.0**.

For collections that support Ansible 2.9, please ensure you update your `network_os` to use the
fully qualified collection name (for example, `cisco.ios.ios`).
Plugins and modules within a collection may be tested with only specific Ansible versions.
A collection may contain metadata that identifies these versions.
PEP440 is the schema used to describe the versions of Ansible.

## Using this collection

```bash
    ansible-galaxy collection install hebailey.utils
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: hebailey.utils
```

To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install hebailey.utils --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax where `X.Y.Z` can be any [available version](https://galaxy.ansible.com/hebailey/utils):

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install hebailey.utils:==X.Y.Z
```
